# Tree-Ai-Assistant
 Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command. In this project, I will make my own personal A.I. assistant using Python from scratch. 
 
 Tree is a virtual AI Assistant coded entirely on python. This application uses the likes of modules like pyttsx3, sapi5 and voiceID.

pyttsx3 :
A python library that will help us to convert text to speech. In short, it is a text-to-speech library.
It works offline, and it is compatible with Python 2 as well as Python 3.

sapi5 :
Microsoft developed speech API.
Helps in synthesis and recognition of voice.

VoiceId :
Voice id helps us to select different voices.
voice[0].id = Male voice voice[1].id = Female voice
